WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO USE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN KEEPING ALL YOUR WORK LOCAL?

Two main ways come to mind, the first one would be if you're using multiple computers, maybe at home you
thought of something to improve your work and left your laptop at the office, you could be sharing the repository
with yourself. The second, and most important one, is so that you can share your project with other people
to colaborate between all of you on the same file.

WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO ALWAYS PULL CHANGES MANUALLY RATHER THAN HAVING GIT AUTOMATICALLY STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH YOUR
REMOTE REPOSITORY?

There might be changes that need to be checked before bringing to the master file if you are the person in charge
of the project and the adds have been made by different contributors, this way the file in your local computer would
be the master and the online one would be a "branch" of the project.

DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORKS, CLONES AND BRANCHES. WHE WOULD YOU USE ONE INSTEAD OF ANOTHER?

Fork and clone are almost the same, fork is used to copy a repository from a git-hub user to your user (all on
github's page) where clone you would be graving a repository (either from your user or someone else) and copying it
locally on your computer. Branches, on the other hand, are when you have a repository and you are trying something
new, different, big change, or someone will be helping you but you want to keep the master version intact, you would
create a branch where you can change without worry that the master work could be lost.

WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A COPY OF THE LAST KNOWN STATE OF THE REMOTE STORED LOCALLY?

It allows you to check with the online version once you are ready to push your local work, this way, if there has
been any changes/collaborations, you would not lose your changes when pushing but can make a pull first which would
merge the changes with your local repository and keep everything together.
