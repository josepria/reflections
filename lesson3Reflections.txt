WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO USE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN KEEPING ALL YOUR WORK LOCAL?

Two main ways come to mind, the first one would be if you're using multiple computers, maybe at home you
thought of something to improve your work and left your laptop at the office, you could be sharing the repository 
with yourself. The second, and most important one, is so that you can share your project with other people
to colaborate between all of you on the same file.
