WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INITIALIZE A REPOSITORY? WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO IT?

This is the starting point for git to save the instances when we commit, if there is no repository, you can't create a commit

HOW IS THE STAGING AREA DIFFERENT FROM THE WORKING DIRECTORY AND THE REPOSITORY? WHAT VALUE DO YOU THINK IT OFFERS?

The staging area is an in-between of files that you have ready to be commited but may need more files that haven't been finished to complete the commit, this is why it is good to have this area to work with and know what's missing and how to add it.

HOW CAN YOU USE THE STAGING AREA TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ON COMMIT PER LOGICAL CHANGE?

when changing one or multiple files and placing them in the staging area, a git diff will show you what has been modified, right here is where you can see much clearer if it is or not a logical change, or if it's a couple of them, for which you still have time to pace back a bit to make a few commits instead of one to ensure that it is one per logical change

WHAT ARE SOME SITUATIONS WHEN BRANCHES WOULD BE HELPFUL IN KEEPING YOUR HISTORY ORGANIZED? HOW WOULD BRANCHES HELP?

Major changes in the project that have multiple logical changes need to be branced out to be tested properly and be sure that it works before merging with the master branch of the repository.

HOW DO THE DIAGRAMS HELP YOU VISUALIZE THE BRANCH STRUCTURE?

It is a graphic representations of the branches and where they broke apart to be able to have a way of getting to the commit that we are looking for.

WHAT IS THE RESULT OF MERGING TWO BRANCHES TOGETHER? WHY DO WE REPRESENT IT IN THE DIAGRAM THE WAY WE DO?

The result is one straight-ish branch that contains all the commits and it is represented as one commit from two different ones because after the merge you can access both commit branches.
