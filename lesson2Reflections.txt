WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INITIALIZE A REPOSITORY? WHY DO YOU NEED TO DO IT?

This is the starting point for git to save the instances when we commit, if there is no repository, you can't create a commit

HOW IS THE STAGING AREA DIFFERENT FROM THE WORKING DIRECCTORY AND THE REPOSITORY? WHAT VALUE DO YOU THINK IT OFFERS?

The staging area is an in-between of files that you have ready to be commited but may need more files that haven't been finished to complete the commit, this is why it is good to have this area to work with and know what's missing and how to add it.
